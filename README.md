# Microsolidarity

In late 2018, Richard D. Bartlett published a [proposal](proposal.md) to start a "microsolidarity" community in Western Europe â€” a small group of people supporting each other to do more meaningful work. 

Reader reactions prompted him to start this website, to collect resources for the co-development of multiple such communities.

### Definition of terms

The proposal introduces some specific use of language:

**Microsolidarity** is a set of practices for mutual support between peers. These methods bring us out of individualism and into a more relational way of being. 

Most of this support happens in a **Crew**: a small group up to about 8 people growing trust in each other through emotional & economic reciprocity. Crews are always designed for intimacy, and may also produce an output \(e.g. a software product or an activist campaign\).

The **Congregation** is a space for Crews to co-develop in the company of other Crews. Congregations have less than a few hundred people, so they can be primarily governed through trust and dialogue.

Many Congregations could form an **Assembly**. 

_For more context on these definitions, read the original_ [_proposal_](proposal.md)_._
