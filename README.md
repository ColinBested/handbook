# Microsolidarity

A collection of resources for people who want to support each other to do more meaningful work. This support happens mostly in "Crews", small groups up to about 8 people. The focus of a Crew may live anywhere on a spectrum between professional-personal, economic-emotional, productive-reproductive, hands-hearts, doing-being.

We propose that Crews co-develop in the company of other Crews. A collective of Crews is a Congregation. Many Congregations could form an Assembly. For more context, read the original [proposal](proposal.md).

The intention for this website is to collect, design, and test methods for finding, starting, and nurturing Crews. Primarily these methods are designed for people outside of a formal organisational context, e.g. freelancers and activists. However many of them may migrate smoothly into organisations. The important factor is that people support each other in peer-to-peer relationships of mutual aid.
