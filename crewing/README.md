# Crewing

These methods are primarily designed for people outside of a formal organisational context, e.g., freelancers and activists. However many of them may migrate smoothly into organisations. These are ways for people to support each other in peer-to-peer relationships of mutual aid.



Here's some specific methods that groups have used:

* [Pods](http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/pods.html) personal-and-professional development in small groups, a new practice in development at Enspiral. \(For more on this: listen to the [recording of the Crews/Pods session at Enspiral Summer Retreat 2019](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/discussing/enspiral-summer-retreat-feb-2019).\)
* [The Elephants](https://medium.com/things-ive-written/the-elephants-182870501589) long term personal development for Crews
* [Feelz Circle](http://emotionalanarchism.com/how-to-form-a-radical-feelz-circle/): 3 processes for sharing emotional care between friends/ comrades/ lovers
* [Stewardship](https://loomio.coop/stewarding.html) peer support system for Partnerships
* [Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com/en/circle-guides): a guided 12-week process for peer support in small groups: _what am I trying to do? who is related to that goal? how can I contribute to them to deepen our relationship?_

## Forming

How is Crew formed? We're not sure. Rich's original [proposal](../proposal.md) suggests the best way to meet your Crew-mates is in a Congregation: a larger gathering of people with some shared values and medium-high trust. The core patterns linked above may help, but there's many experiments to be done.

ðŸ”ˆ[In this podcast](https://anchor.fm/emerge/episodes/Ria-Baeck---Emergent-Collective-Practice-and-Applied-Presence-e2qppp/a-a83fd7) with Daniel Thorson, Ria Baeck suggests the best place to start is at home, with a few guests gathered around a compelling question.
